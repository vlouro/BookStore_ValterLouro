# BookStore_ValterLouro

What was used: Swift with UIKit and MVVM

Regarding the project: Had to add an APIKey for requests since it was always complaining on the limit requests.
As for the load more, sometimes the startIndex parameter brings some equal books but I didn't filter the array on the code to remove duplicates.

For Improvements: The use of SwiftUI with combine for better and updated code/technology. Load more on the favorites list, for the list with requests there is a loading more while scrolling.

As for the Network part, I would improve the request errors/handling, there isn't an option to retry if there is an error.
