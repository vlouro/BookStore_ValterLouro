# BookStore_ValterLouro

What was used: Swift with UIKit and MVVM

Regarding the project: 

For Improvements: The use of SwiftUI with combine for better and updated code/technology. Load more on the favorites list, for the list with requests there is a loading more while scrolling.

As for the Network part, I would improve the request errors/handling, there isn't na option to retry if there is an error.
